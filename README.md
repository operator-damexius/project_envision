> *"Unknown variables have entered the sector equation. Strange, adaptive signals are emanating from the fringe, accompanied by fleets that defy standard classification. The Envision Protocol is active."*

**Project Envision** (formerly *Solvaris Remnant*) is a high-tech content expansion for Starsector. It introduces the **Solvaris Remnant**, a faction guided by an esoteric AI known as the Oracle, featuring unique mechanics, industries, and a legendary ring system.

## 🌌 New System: Vailara
Hidden within a custom blue nebula lies **Vailara**, a legendary star system defined by **40 distinct concentric rings**.
* **Nyxara:** An arid mining world rich in rare ores.
* **Orvion Fortress:** A massive **Size-8 Battle Station** orbiting an Ice Giant. Orvion serves as the iron shield of the system, fully self-sufficient and heavily defended.
* **Zyphir:** A ruined desert world echoing with the ghosts of the past.

## 🚀 The Oracle Fleet
A new line of ships featuring phase-alloy armor and quantum-entangled targeting arrays:
* **Vortex (Interceptor):** A blurred dagger in the void, utilizing unstable gravimetric drives to run down elusive targets.
* **Defiance (Cruiser):** A bulwark against entropy, mounting experimental phase-armor that disperses projectile impacts.
* **Divergence (Capital):** A massive cathedral of war with a split-prow design focused on terrifying energy projection.

## 🏭 Industrial Synergies
Project Envision introduces advanced colony structures that unlock hidden potential when controlled by AI Cores:

* **Nehul Logistics Frame:** * *Standard:* A capable logistics hub.
    * *Alpha Core:* Activates "Martial Law Protocols," significantly boosting stability and ground defenses.
* **Dzianis Outpost:** * *Alpha Core:* Unlocks "Total War" doctrine, spawning heavy patrols and massively expanding fleet limits.
* **Argent Uplink:** * *Alpha Core:* The "Argent AI Coordinator" optimizes local stability and defense grids.
* **Dyson Hub:** * *Alpha Core:* Activates the **"Panopticon"**, purging Luddic Path sleeper cells and permanently masking the colony from Pather interest.
