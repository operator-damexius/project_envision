# Project Envision
**Version 0.7.2**

> *"From the frozen halo of Cryon to the scorching rings of Seraphina, the Solvaris Federation stands as a testament to humanity's endurance, while the Argent Concordat watches from the dark."*

## 🌌 Overview
**Project Envision** is a content expansion mod for Starsector. This update introduces the **Solvaris Trinity**—a custom constellation of three star systems—and populates them with two distinct, high-tech factions:
* **The Solvaris Remnant:** A disciplined industrial power utilizing "Deep Blue" aesthetics and heavy capital ships.
* **The Argent Concordat:** A hostile AI faction obsessed with acquiring AI cores and fielding high-tech Remnant fleets.

The mod features hand-crafted planetary conditions, custom map generation labels, and deep lore integration.
