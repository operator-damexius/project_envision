# Project Envision 👁️

> *"I have met the enemy, and they are us."*

**Project Envision** introduces the **Oracle Project**—a secret high-tech weapons development program that pushes the limits of flux capacity and energy weapon output. These ships are designed to be "Boss Tier" threats.

## 🚀 Update v0.6.1: Protocol Omega
The latest update introduces the **Oracle Test Wing** and the terrifying **"Protocol Omega"** mission.

### 🌌 New Ships (The Oracle Series)
* **SS Defiance (Dreadnought):** An apex predator designed to break capital ship formations.
* **SS Divergence (Cruiser):** Heavy support and suppression.
* **SS Vortex (Destroyer):** High-speed interception.

### ⚔️ New Mission: "Protocol Omega"
Located in the **Vespera System**, this classified testing site allows you to field test the Oracle prototypes against increasing odds.

* **Standard Protocol:** Field test against Hegemony patrols.
* **Extinction Protocol:** Survive against a **United Sector Coalition** (Onslaughts, Paragons, and Doom Phase Cruisers).
* **Civil War (Mirror Match):** A glitch in the simulation pits you against **yourself**. Fight a rogue copy of your fleet inside a destabilized **Blue Giant** system filled with nebula and asteroid fields.

## 📦 Installation
