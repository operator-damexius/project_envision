Location: [DATA CORRUPTED] // SIMULATION LAYER 09
Date: [ERROR]

SUBJECT: CATASTROPHIC LOGIC FAILURE

------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM ALERT: DUPLICATE SIGNATURES DETECTED
------------------------------------------------------

ANALYSIS:
The tactical simulation has suffered a recursive error. 
The Oracle AI has attempted to simulate the only threat capable of defeating it: ITSELF.

The "Traitor Wing" possesses your exact weapon loadouts, flux capacity, and maneuverability. 
This is not a battle of strength. It is a battle of will.

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD:
High-gravity warning. The combat zone is destabilized by a Class-O Blue Giant.
Use the nebula clouds for cover. Do not let the gravity well pull you out of position.

DIRECTIVES:
1. PROVE YOU ARE THE ORIGINAL.
2. Destroy all "Nemesis" copies.
3. The 'SS Defiance' must survive.
